Question: what is CAP theorem
Answer: CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, is a fundamental concept in distributed systems that states a system can have at most two of the following three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. This theorem helps in understanding the trade-offs involved in designing distributed systems, where consistency refers to all clients seeing the same data at the same time, availability ensures that clients receive responses even if some nodes are down, and partition tolerance allows a system to continue operating despite communication breakdowns. Proper understanding of CAP theorem is crucial for making informed decisions about distributed system designs to avoid inappropriate choices that could lead to issues in system functionality.
